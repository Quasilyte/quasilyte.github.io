      <title>log.Fatal vs log.Panic</title>

      <description>I personally don&amp;rsquo;t like log.Fatal/Fatalf/Fatalln. I feel sad because of their ubiquity in Go examples as a form of reaction to an error. I personally prefer log.Panic.
The log.Panic vs log.Fatal is essentially panic vs os.Exit(1). The latter will not let deferred calls to run. Most of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s not what you want. It also makes testing much harder. It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple to stop panic in test by the means of recover.</description>

      <title>Go compiler: SSA optimization rules description language</title>

      <description>Original (ru): https://habr.com/post/415771/.
 Go compiler uses its own Lisp-like domain-specific language (DSL) for Static Single Assignment (SSA) optimization rules description.
Lets dig into that language, its peculiarities and limitations. As an excercise, we&amp;rsquo;ll add a new optimization rule into Go compiler that would optimize expressions like a*b+c using new operations we&amp;rsquo;re going to implement along the way.
This is the first article in the series about Go compiler SSA backend, this is why I&amp;rsquo;ve included some fundamental and architectural info besides DSL overview.</description>

      <title>Go AVX-512 support</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/go-avx512/</link>

      <description>About this document This article is going to be up-to-date source of AVX-512 information in Go context.
It references other posts, official documentation and other useful resources.
It&amp;rsquo;s short. By purpose.
Only English content is referenced (original + translated).
Documentation  AVX-512 support in Go assembler: short reference that focuses on Go-specific implementation of AVX-512. It describes how to use all AVX-512 special features in Go assembly syntax as well as some encoder details.</description>

      <title>Disassembling Go AVX-512</title>

      <guid>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/disassembling-go-avx512/</guid>
      <description>The problem Go 1.11 got updated assembler that supports AVX-512, but disassembler is left unchanged.
In other words, go tool asm speaks AVX-512, go tool objdump does not.
Suppose we have this avx.s file:
TEXT Â·avxCheck(SB), 0, $0 VPOR X0, X1, X2 //; AVX1 VPOR Y0, Y1, Y2 //; AVX2 VPORD.BCST (DX), Z1, K2, Z2 //; AVX-512 RET  You will be surprised after assemble+disassemble attempt:
$ go tool asm avx.</description>

      <title>Dispatch tables in Go asm</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/go-asm-dispatch-tables/</link>

      <description>Dispatch tables When you want to execute particular code path depending on some kind of tag/opcode or other integer value that can be easily mapped into index, dispatch tables can speed things up compared to the sequence of comparisons and conditional jumps.
In interpreters, this technique is often used as an alternative to switch-based dispatch.
It&amp;rsquo;s called direct threading in that domain. Each opcode corresponds to table index that contains machine code address that can execute operation specified by the opcode.</description>

      <title>Goism objects layout model</title>

      <description>Introduction Goism project requires Go pointers emulation inside Emacs Lisp code.
This document describes how to achive (almost) full functionality with potential to have optimizations that eliminate some of the emulation-related overhead.
The actual implementation can diverge. Only initial design is outlined.
Struct representation Go structures represented by lists.
Empty struct run-time value is unspecified, but it satisfies Go spec requirements.
type a1 struct { f1 int } // a1{1} // (list 1) type a2 struct { f1, f2, f3, f4 int } // a2{1, 2, 3, 4} // (list 1 2 3 4)  For the very small (1-3 fields) objects lists are a better choice than vectors, but generally, vectors are more memory-efficient and provide faster random access.</description>

      <title>Writing Emacs Lisp compiler intrinsics</title>

      <description>The problem Given a particular programming task in Emacs Lisp, you almost always should implement it with function. Sometimes, macro is a proper tool.
Even more rarely, cl-define-compiler-macro may be your choice.
All these methods are safe to use. They almost certanly will not break with newer Emacs versions.
One interesting task that can not be implemented efficiently with approaches that are outlined above is imperative return statement.
Emacs Lisp lacks this kind of flow control and this is a problem we are goind to attack today.</description>

      <description>Third flavour of x86 assembly language This article is heavily inspired by AT&amp;amp;T VS Intel/Microsoft assembly syntax comparison page. It helped me very much in the past.
Many tools understand both AT&amp;amp;T and Intel style assembly. Go derived Plan9 toolchain, so you should learn third kind of assembly language. It will not accept anything else.
In this document:
 Comparison of Plan9/Go and AT&amp;amp;T/GNU assembly; Some non-obvious details that are not described anywhere else; Links to useful resources;  Check external resources for information that is missing here.</description>

      <title>Go nested functions and static locals</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/go-nested-functions-and-static-locals/</link>

      <description>Symbol visibility Default symbol visibility should be as narrow as possible. This means that you use globals with internal linkage instead of external, local variables rather than globals, hide class-related constants inside it&amp;rsquo;s scope, and so on.
If function is only called inside particular function, it should become a nested function.
Most of these rely on the language support.
Go has quite simple model of scopes and symbol visibility. User-defined identifier can be local or package-local (global).</description>

      <title>Path to convenient C FFI in Go</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/cgo-funcall/</link>

      <guid>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/cgo-funcall/</guid>
      <description>DWIM-style FFI CGo is a widely adopted way of calling C functions from Go: low level C FFI which does many things behind the scene, but exposes only minimal functionality that is required to interact with C.
CGo does no implicit conversions or data copying during C functions call, even int and C.int are not compatible. Code that uses this mechanism without wrappers (bindings) will be polluted with explicit slice/array copies and type conversions.</description>

      <title>RISC-V: custom instruction and its simulation</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/riscv32-custom-instruction-and-its-simulation/</link>

      <guid>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/riscv32-custom-instruction-and-its-simulation/</guid>
      <description>Agenda This article shows how to add a new instruction to RISC-V and simulate it.
These topics are covered along the way:
 Whole GNU riscv toolchain installation; Implementation of a new instruction for spike RISC-V ISA simulator; Manual instruction encoding in C/C++; Custom instruction simulation (with visible output); [riscv32-]GCC plugin development;  You may find associated repository useful.
Many things can go wrong. Be prepared to fix upcoming issues by yourself.</description>

      <title>Emacs Lisp multi return values</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/elisp-multi-return-values/</link>

      <guid>https://quasilyte.github.io/blog/post/elisp-multi-return-values/</guid>
      <description>The missing feature Did you ever wrote a function in Emacs Lisp which should return more than one result?
Emacs Lisp has no native support for multiple return values, but provides cl-lib that emulates it in a Common Lisp style.
In this article I will show that cl-values is suboptimal and can be replaced without any sacrifices to the convenience.
Naive solution cl-lib implements cl-values in terms of list. This approach is naive because each time you return with that, an allocation is involved.</description>

      <title>C broken defaults</title>

      <description>State of the C C fits its niche quite well. If you want relatively simple, ubiquitous and efficient language there is no much room for selection.
It &amp;ldquo;evolves so slowly&amp;rdquo; because it is already quite complete. Most of the parts that can be improved without making C yet another bloated language require breaking changes.
 C could be designed better if we accept older code invalidation.
 &amp;hellip;but in reallity it is impossible to achieve.</description>
